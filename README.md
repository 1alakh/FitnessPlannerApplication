# FitnessPlannerApplication

●The Fitness planner system is an application that is designed for the gym admin as well as clients where the gym admin can monitor, and analyze the records and
activities of all the clients and get all information in one place.

● Clients can maintain their exercise records and see the activities at any point in time, get BMR, TDEE, Macro-Nutrients and obtain a Meal plan according to the 
goal that is gaining, cutting, and maintenance phase and based on the number of meals. Clients can also use a 1RM calculator to prevent injuries.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

In the current system there are applications having some faults that we are covering through our project:

●	Macros are calculated with same formula for all the users
but some of them can be football players, athlete or doing some kind of endurance sport that will give them incorrect result while calculating their daily intake
●	None of them provide distribution of daily calories based on number of meals per day
●	The current system does not provide their uses 1 RM calculator to provide the weight to be lifted in the next set without any injury
●	There are problems in maintaining log file of exercise record of users related with past record of last years
●	The current system does not handle any exceptions and give results for out-of-range values also so we will include validation also

Objective:

1.	To find the macro-nutrients and calculate calories intake of user in maintenance phase, gaining phase and cutting phase/ fat loss phase.
2.	To prepare the diet chart on the basis of number of meals per day and goal of the user
3.	To give users a diary to maintain their activity record and track the previous record through log file
4.	Allowing the users to use 1RM based calculator on basis of which they can find the percentage of 1 rep max depending upon their goals
